## About

This project is a complete fan translation of the Rock Band 3 Deluxe title to brazilian portuguese. The translation also includes translation from the RB3DX additional options and features. On this repository, you'll only find files to replace in your Rock Band 3 Deluxe build's `_ark` folder, replacing the original english locales to brazilian ones (since the game doesn't have a language detection that supports brazilian portuguese consoles).

If you don't know how to build Rock Band 3 Deluxe patch, check the [Download](#download) section below to use a manually-build version of Rock Band 3 Deluxe patch with built-in translation.

This translation is up-to-date with the following Rock Band 3 Deluxe development commit: [Commit b483be1 (fix judgments on ps3/360, add debug option)](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/commit/b483be1cb61029e16c522d44cc0f4e10afdd3879).
