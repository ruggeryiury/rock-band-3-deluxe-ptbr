## About

This project is a complete fan translation of the Rock Band 3 Deluxe title to brazilian portuguese. The translation also includes translation from the RB3DX additional options and features. On this repository, you'll only find files to replace in your Rock Band 3 Deluxe build's `_ark` folder, replacing the original english locales to brazilian ones (since the game doesn't have a language detection that supports brazilian portuguese consoles).

If you don't know how to build Rock Band 3 Deluxe patch, check the Download section below to use a manually-build version of Rock Band 3 Deluxe patch with built-in translation.
